# phonynetwork

Phony is a new server emulation project founded by same team who brought you Pretendo Network, only this time for PSN on the PlayStation 3 and PS Vita! With this new project, we hope to breathe life into a whole new set of consoles on a new platform! Phony will support many features out of the gate, including custom PSN accounts, new trophies in your favorite games, and of course online play in games whose servers have been shut down. We hope to see you join us on this new journey!
